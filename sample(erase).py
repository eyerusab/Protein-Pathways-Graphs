# Example Question: How could you "slice" the dictionary to print "Feature" from line 15?
# Answer: print schools["type"]

# Question 1: What slice will give you a dictionary 
#   with the key of "coordinates" and a value containing a list
#   of two decimal numbers?
print schools['geometry']['coordinates']

# Question 2: What slice will give you the address of the school?
print schools['properties']['address']
# Question 3: What slice will give you the name of the school?

# Question 4: What slice will give you the latitude of the school? 
#   (Hint: the latitude is 39.216...)

# Question 5 (bonus): What slice will give you the marker-color 
#   without the hashtag in front?

# How to add a new item to an existing dictionary:
contacts["Aliya Rahman"] = {
    "twitter": "@AliyaRahman",
    "github": "https://github.com/aliyarahman"
}

# Exercise 1: Add a new dictionary item to contacts for each person at your table.
#   Rather than editing lines 1-10 above, add new entries to the contacts dictionary below.
#   Keep in mind some people may not have a twitter account, and that's okay!

contacts["Eyerusalem Abebe"] = {
    "twitter": "@eyerus_ab",
    "github": "https://github.com/eyerusab"
}

print contacts




for key in sorted(contacts.keys()):
	print contacts[key]['twitter']

print contacts.items()

#for key, value in contacts.items():
#	print key, '\t', value
#	for nested_key, nested_value in value.items():
#		print nested_key, nested_value

for key, value in contacts.items():
	print key
	for nested_key, nested_value in value.items():
		print nested_key, nested_value


# Exercise 2: Loop through the contacts dictionary to display everyone's contact information.
#   Your output should look like this:

#for nested_key, nested_value 
# Hear Me Code's info: 
#     twitter: @hearmecode
#     github: https://github.com/hearmecode
# Shannon Turner's info: 
#     twitter: @svt827
#     github: https://github.com/shannonturner
